        <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>

        <p>
            A tuna salad is a light yet satisfying dish, typically made by combining canned tuna with a variety of fresh ingredients. 
            <br>The tuna is usually mixed with mayonnaise or Greek yogurt to create a creamy base, though some recipes use olive oil or mustard for a lighter option.</br> 
            Classic add-ins include finely chopped celery, onions, pickles, or relish for crunch and tang, as well as hard-boiled eggs for richness. 
            <br>Fresh herbs like parsley or dill can brighten up the flavor, while a squeeze of lemon juice adds a refreshing citrus note.</br>
            Often served on a bed of leafy greens, in a sandwich, or as a filling for wraps, a tuna salad is versatile, easy to make, and packed with protein.
